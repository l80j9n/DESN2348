Appendix 1: Primary Data Collection  Human Research Ethics Those of you who are planning to collect primary data via methods such as in-person interviews, questionnaires or focus groups will have to think about ethical considerations such as consent forms and anonymity. However, for those of you whose research is primarily based on secondary sources then the process of Informed Consent will not be necessary.Please refer also to the advice given in the Dissertation module’s Minerva space Any form. of research that involves the researcher (the student) interacting with another person or group of people may have ethical issues that should be considered during the design of the project.At their simplest these issues may be:· Politeness: are questions in an interview or survey written in such a way as not to give offence?· Confidentiality: do you have a duty for participants in your research to remain anonymous? This may be for personal reasons or matters of commercial confidentiality.· Obscene and offensive material: could material (of any media) used in the research be considered offensive to any group of people?· Awareness  Consent: are the participants in your research aware of the purpose of the research and have given their consent to being included in your study?In brief, the Verbal Informed Consent Protocol refers to research:·   Where written informed consent is not possible for instance in telephone interviews·   Where informal data collection methods are to be used, as happens in neighbourhood and community studies, for instance·   Where participants in the research are illiterate or semi-literate·   Where asking participants to review and sign forms that have an air of officialdom about them might be considered risky by the participant·   Where cultural issues are raised by signing a document as is the case in some Middle Eastern Societies.The Informed Consent Protocol is more explicit in its requirements, for example researchers should take the steps necessary to ensure that all participants in the research:·   Understand the process in which they are to be engaged, including why their participation is necessary·   Understand the purpose of the research and how and to whom its research findings will be reportedIn the Dissertation module’s Minerva space, you will find a model Information Sheet (to be given to the participant in advance of consent) and a model Participant Consent Form. Students are asked to use these templates to guide independent data collection for the Strategic Plan. All parties must sign the consent form. and receive their own copy, this would include:·   Participant·   Name of Person Taking Consent (Student Researcher)
Appendix 2: Frequently asked questions (FAQ)  If I want to carry out some primary research using questionnaires, where can I find the link to the university's survey platform. that they want us to use.  The University of Leeds online survey link is below https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it/Android?id=kb_articlesysparm_article=KB0011251 How do I reference images in the body of the text?We advise you to include figure numbers for each image. You do not need to include the title of each figure, but you should include the figure reference number beside each image. The text in your submission should use the University referencing system. Images should be referenced by numbering each item and adding a figure reference list at the end. This applies also to moodboard if using images that are not yours.The Word Count (4,500 words) includes everything in the main body of the text (including citations and quotes). Do not cram text into tables as they should be concise. Headings, tables, diagrams, reference lists are not included in the word count.Can I create all my content on InDesign or Canva and then upload it on PebblePad as an image? No, you are not allowed to do so as text in the Portfolio needs to be easy to browse and read. Also, text need to be accessible by TurnItIn for plagiarism purposes.How do I submit the reflective log mentioned in Learning Outcome 4? And do I need to use a specific framework for my reflections? Every time you are required to include reflections in a Page of your portfolio, you are basically including your reflective log. You won’t need to submit a separate document. It is all included in the Research Log.You are not required to use a specific framework for reflections, but you are welcome to use one if you wish. You can also create your own framework or combine multiple frameworks.If you are unsure on how to write personal reflections, here you can find some useful resources.

To make sure you are working in the right direction, marking criteria with clear explanations are provided in the next page.Who is going to mark my work? All your portfolios will be doubled marked, meaning two different member of staff are assigned to mark one portfolio. The assessment team is listed in the assessment brief at the beginning of this document.Before the assessment team proceed with assigned projects, a benchmarking exercise is performed. The team individually assess a small sample of submission and then meet to discuss marking and agree on a mark for each of the individual projects included in the sample. These marks are then kept as a reference point to mark all other submissions.
